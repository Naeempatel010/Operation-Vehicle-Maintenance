# Operational Vehicle Maintenance using AR/VR Developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2019, The world's Largest Hackathon with nearly 784 Teams for across the country Participating.

This project won the First Prize at the Hackathon.


This project was modified to make it suitable to work for the Operational vehicle maintainance.we use the base model of Matterport Masked RCNN for which I express my gratitude for making it open source


The project works just in a similar manner to how it does for matterport/Masked-RCNN but added many new functionalities like restful api for recognising vehicle parts and then also a mobile application.This also has a tornado server which can be run by running the server3.py file available 


More additions are still on the way so please be patient....
