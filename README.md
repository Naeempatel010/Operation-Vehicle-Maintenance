# Operational Vehicle Maintenance using AR/VR Developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2019, The world's Largest Hackathon with nearly 784 Teams for across the country Participating.

This project won the First Prize at the Hackathon.This project was modified to make it suitable to work for the Operational vehicle maintainance.we use the base model of Matterport Masked RCNN for which I express my gratitude for making it open source

Steps :-
# 1. Annotating the Data
A Mask R-CNN model requires the user to annotate the images and identify the region of damage. The annotation tool I used is the VGG Image Annotator — v 1.0.6. You can use the html version available at http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via-1.0.6.html . Using this tool you can create a polygon mask as shown below:





Once you have created all the annotations, you can download the annotation and save it in a json format. You can look at my images and annotations on my repository here.
